ElasticSearch Concepts

Distributed real-time storage, search and analytics engine.
Schema free
No prior data declaration required, but possible, to optimize
Document oriented (JSON)
Real time: 
Acquisition: data is indexed in real time
Analytics: explore, understand your data
High availability: Shards and replicas auto balanced
Command example:
Create index : curl -XPOST localhost:9200/logstash-2014.09.22/
Delete existant index: curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/logstash-2014.09.22/
Bulk insert : curl -s -XPUT localhost:9200/_bulk --data-binary @bulk.json
Create mapping :  curl -XPOST localhost:9200/logstash-2014.09.22/databaseData/_mapping –d
Search: curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/library/book/_search?q=term1:criteria1&pretty=true' 



Kibana Concepts

Built with AngularJS:
JavaScript MVC framework for client-side rich application
Developed and maintained by Google
JS directly queries ElasticSearch
Create nice graphs based on documents stored in elasticsearch.
View and aggregate different forms of data from ElasticSearch.
Tow types of aggregations: bucketing and metric
Bucketing aggregations produce a list of buckets, each one with a set of documents that belong to it (e.g., terms, range, date range, histogram). 
Metric aggregations keep track and compute metrics over a set of documents (e.g., min, max, sum, avg, stats).

The GBIS Developer Getting Started Guide
I didn't keep track of the time I spent installing and configuring my tools back in the day to work with the proxy and the developer account limitations. Over the years, I found better tools and discovered useful tricks that other developers might find useful today. I hope this will be the start of something where we can all share what makes us what we are at heart : programmers. -- Gilles, 25 aug 2014.
Please don't hesitate to fork and submit Pull Requests to enhance this guide, you can also watch this repo for changes.

The minimum stuff you should install from AppsOnDemand (win key then type AppsOnDemand)

Firefox or Chrome, because IE8 can't display most modern websites, notably GitHub
Sametime to communicate with teammates and other people by chat (challenge : find the option to launch it at Windows startup)
Telisca ClickNDial to launch a phone call from your desktop
Freeware 7Zip-X64, which I find less bloated than WinZip which comes with the NDG master
GadWin PrintScreen, to take screenshots
Jive for Outlook to create discussions from emails and see your correspondent activity (requires access to Jive currently in closed beta inside GBIS)
Get extended rights

Normally you should have "Extended Rights" on your machine which allows you to use packages that require those like Visual Studio. Send this email to 35000 asking for extended rights with the MA of your machine and add your manager in /cc.

Hi,

For my day to day activity, I require extended rights
e.g. I'll have to :
- Debug with Visual Studio,  
- Profile applications running on my machine 
- Create COM components

My machine's MA is : MAxxxxxx
Configure the proxy

The first thing you should do is configure the proxy at the system level. Add the 3 environment variables underneath in "Control Panel\System and Security\System\Advanced system settings\Environment Variables". Be aware that git-bash doesn't automatically inherit Windows system level environment variables so you have to put them in your personal account ~/.profile file.

Put the following lines in you cmd script if you don't have admin rights :

SET HTTP_PROXY=http://firstname.name:internetpassword@proxy.int.world.socgen:8080
SET HTTPS_PROXY=http://firstname.name:internetpassword@proxy.int.world.socgen:8080
SET NO_PROXY=.socgen
Put this in your ~/.profile :

export http_proxy='http://firstname.name:internetpassword@proxy.int.world.socgen:8080'
export https_proxy='http://firstname.name:internetpassword@proxy.int.world.socgen:8080'
export no_proxy=.socgen
Remap Caps Lock to CTRL

If you are a fast typer or a know-all-the-shortcuts guy, you should know that you can remap the Caps Lock key as CTRL to avoid pinky.

Basic Gear

Equipment

First, you should install a few things from the ITEC-Toolbox. I always unselect everything and I pick only the following :

Msysgit : because Git rocks, and also because we now have our own GitHub Enterprise. Learn Git if you don't use it already.

Gnuwin32 : lots of useful unix tools which you can use either from cmd or from gitbash which comes with msysgit

ProcessExplorer : a very good replacement for the built-in process manager

Notepad++ : a decent text editor

The Continuous Delivery platform is composed with those tools :

Jira 6.2 Agile

GitHub Enterprise. We have 300 seats only, reserved for Continuous Delivery apps, contact ARC/CoC to enlist on the migration roadmap.

SonarQube

Additional software are listed on itbox

Java specced

Now, if you're a Java developer, you can also install these packages from the ITEC-Toolbox :

JDK 7 and 8

they come with the SGCIB certificates, which avoids patching your own JDKs to access internal services which are only reachable with https (jira, nexus etc...)

Maven 3

Eclipse (wait, DON'T. You can have something better, go on reading... Yes, strong opinions FTW !)

.NET specced

If you're a .NET developer, you must use Visual Studio and Resharper.

Hi, 

I need to have the latest versions of Visual Studio and Resharper installed. 

CA : <CA number>
TBS : <Pnnnnn or Snnnnn)>
MA : <machine number, type hostname at the command prompt>
An Itrack case will then be created and someone will call you to ask if you're sure you want to BUY a license Visual Studio. Answer YES because in reality, a BUY will not be performed, rather the licence count tracked by ITEC/COO will be increased for your RC (COO contact is Anthony FERRE). Do not hesitate to call 35000 regularly (once a week at least).

The lastest versions available today are Visual Studio 2013 and Resharper 8. SGCIB will have very soon a group license for Resharper and hence a License Server which will allow to use any version of Resharper and get upgrades for free.

FYI, we are still looking into how Visual Studio 2013 can be packaged by GTS. In the meantime, architects and senior developers can get an MSDN account to download and install VS 2013.

SQL specced

If you have to fiddle with SQL databases, you can either use DBVisualizer Free, Oracle SQL Developer or MS SQL Server Management Studio if you use MS-SQL (Someone told me SG has a server license for this one, to be confirmed).
To manage the datamodel and dataset changes in an automatically deployable way, you may give liquibase a try.

Advanced Gear

Equipment

Now if you ask me, the best tools out there are in the following list. Note that none of these tools are available in a packaged way by support team. I've been preparing during the last couple of week packaging requests to GTS to make most of them available through AppsOnDemand.

IntelliJ Ultimate Edition. It's the best JVM-languages IDE whatsoever, and yes I know Vim AND Emacs. Also I won't go into details about why it beats Eclipse hands down for anything. If you're curious there are plenty of articles over the internet. Setup the proxy by invoking the settings dialog, type proxy in the search field on the top left. Then fill the hostname, port and user/password fields. You'll be able to download plugins which are bundled as jars. Those packaged as zip will be forbidden unless download rights have been granted to you by 35000 (PYX required). Also add socgen to the 'No Proxy For' field so you'll be able to use things like the Atlassian plugin and connect to the on-premise SGCIB Jira instance.

Sublime Text version 2 or 3 (beta). It's the best -modern- developer text editor, with a lot of powerful plugins. Install Package Control then edit the package control user settings (Preferences -> Package Settings -> Package Control -> Settings - User) and add those keys :

{
"proxy_username": "<firstname.name>",
"proxy_password": "<internetpassword>"
}
Now, provided you've set the proxy system variable (see top of this page), ST should be able to list the available packages (ctrl-shift-P, type Package Install). If not, you should probably also set the http_proxy and/or https_proxy keys as well.

YourKit It's the best JVM profiler, period.

DBVisualizer Pro which has a helluva lot more features than the free one. Get this gem if you spend most of your time dealing with databases.

ConEmu. It's a very nice Windows console window enhancement. It was created as a companion to FarManager then it outgrew the original goal. Read the praising reviews by many renowned developers (including Scott Hanselman, Microsoft developer & Stackoverflow co-founder). Best of all, it's open source. A valuable alternative is PowerCMD but it's closed source.

Ex : How to add GitBash to ConEmu

Far Manager. It's a program for managing files and archives in Windows operating systems. It goes along very well with ConEmu which is in this list too.

Clink. Clink combines the native Windows shell cmd.exe with the powerful command line editing features of the GNU Readline library, which provides rich completion, history, and line-editing capabilities. Readline is best known for its use in the well-known Unix shell Bash, the standard shell for Mac OS X and many Linux distributions.

Launchy, a launcher a la Spotlight or Alfred

Baretail, a free real-time log file monitoring tool (as 'tail -f' unix command with highlights)

Baregrep, a free file finding and text searching tool

Acquire Knowledge

Book of Knowledge

You will learn a lot by reading books, much more than you will discover by yourself for sure.

Here's a short selection :

SICP, also know as the "Wizard Book", written by Gerald Jay Sussman and Jay Habelson. It's been used for decades to teach programming at MIT. Read it if you want to truly understand what are the fundamentals of programming and become a much better programmer.
Some classics like Code Complete, Refactoring and Design Patterns teach you the effective working habits and the painstaking details of the trade. Others, like Peopleware, Psychology of Computer Programming and The Mythical Man-Month delve into the psychosocial aspects of software development. Numerous others deal with algorithms. These books all have their place. SICP, however, is in a different league. It is a book that will enlighten you. It will evoke in you a passion for writing beautiful programs. Moreover, it will teach you to recognize and appreciate that very beauty. It will leave you with a state of awe and an unquenchable thirst to learn more. Other books may make you a better programmer; this book will make you a programmer.
Clean Code, by Robert C. Martin aka Uncle Bob. His Clean Coders video serie is also a must-watch.

Specification by Example, by Gojko Adzic. This book which granted the Jolt Award in 2012, will teach you how to write the 'right' software.

You'll find many more on this StackOverflow question : What is the single most influential book every programmer should read ?

Learn New Tricks

Sorceress

Configuration under Version Control

It's a good idea to keep your dotfiles under version control. It's very useful if you're an Emacs or Vim user for example. Create a 'dotfiles' repo on www.github.com and create a subdirectory for each tool. Then you can create a symlink to this repo (runas administrator required):

mklink /D c:\Users\gphilip\.emacs.d c:\Users\gphilip\dotfiles\emacs.d
symbolic link created for c:\Users\gphilip\.emacs.d <<===>> c:\Users\gphilip\dotfiles\emacs.d
Shortcuts

In windows 7, there are a handful of super useful shortcuts. For example try win + UP and win + DOWN inside your favorite browser. Pretty cool hey ?

Here's my favorites :

Shortcut	Context	Effect
shift-right-click	File in Windows Explorer	Adds Copy as Path menu item
win-up	Any window	Maximize window
win-down	Any window	Restore or minimizes window
shift-win-left	Any window	Move window to the far left
shift-win-right	Any window	Dock window to the far right
ctrl-shift-esc	Any window	Launch Task Manager
alt-up	Windows Explorer	Goes up a folder level
ctrl-shift-N	Windows Explorer	Creates a new folder
alt-D	Windows Explorer	Focus the adress bar
shift-alt-up	Powerpoint, Word and Outlook	Moves text/bullet at cursor up
shift-alt-down	Powerpoint, Word and Outlook	Moves text/bullet at cursor down
ctrl-shift-L	Powerpoint, Word and Outlook	switches on/off bullets at current line
shift-alt-right	Powerpoint, Word and Outlook	indent bullets
shift-alt-left	Powerpoint, Word and Outlook	unindent bullets
If you want more, here's an amazing list of Windows 7 shortcuts.

Languages

Sometimes the regular, day-to-day tools come short for doing specific stuff. These tools enable you do quickly prototype or write less complex code.

Clojure & ClojureScript Clojure and ClojureScript are now my default languages. Check out my Getting Started Guide for Clojure :

Node.js. Javascript is everywhere nowadays. Node is a platform built on V8 which allows you to run javascript outside the browser. Here's how you configure the proxy :

npm config set proxy http://<firstname.name>:<internetpwd>@proxy.fr.world.socgen:8080
Sometimes you'll have to use mirrors to install stuff like phantomjs :

PHANTOMJS_CDNURL=http://cnpmjs.org/downloads npm install phantomjs
Ruby. First install Ruby from the ITEC-Toolbox (see above). Then you have to use an unblocked proxy as the gem forge. The following command works on my computer :

gem sources -r http://gems.rubyforge.org
gem sources -a http://production.cf.rubygems.org
gem install compass
Note that to install the Jekyll gem you'll need to install Ruby 1.9.2+ and the Ruby DevKit. There are additional details here : Run Jekyll on Windows. Note that there's a portable version which could save you the hassle of installing and configuring all the above if you'd prefer to start writing your blog in couple minutes (I didn't test it) : https://github.com/madhur/PortableJekyll. Note that our GitHub Enterprise is only compatible with jekyll 2.2.0 so you have to use declare this in your Gemfile :

gem 'jekyll','2.2.0'
and use

bundle exec jekyll new myblog
to create your blog.

Things you can't use here

Here are a few things that can't be used mainly due to proxy restrictions :

Chocolatey. It's a very nice and promising package manager for Windows (a la Homebrew for Mac) which boasts more than 2000 packages. Actually, if you've got extended rights, you can install it but further down the road, you can't download any packages, the S3 curse strikes again !

Complex Event Processing Introduction
	Provide a technology to detect various business conditions by monitoring 
	 a flow of events and recognizing patterns as they occur
	Aggregate and correlate these events into higher level “business events” 
	 that can be used to trigger business process to handle the various 
	 detected conditions
	
Anatomy Of Complex Event Processing
Ability to recognize event patterns
Ability to aggregate event patterns into higher level event structures
Ability to correlate / match events to business objects
Ability to process and effect / drive  business object state
Ability to model process / state based timing expectations ie timeouts / lack of event support

CEP Applications:
Supply Chain Event Monitoring (SCEM)
Monitor processes from multiple perspectives ie (Cost, Availability, and location) and ensure that process execute as expected and with in expected timeframes
SLA Management
Provide a means to proactively manage, identify, and proactively resolve exceptions on  processes that effect service level agreements 
Score Carding / Performance Monitoring
Provide a platform for measuring process execution statistics over time

Proposed Project
Use Business Events to Monitor Loads moving through a SIROCCO-DTCC chain
Define states, timeouts and such to monitor large volumes of loads on a daily basis.  The goal would be to identify loads that are running behind schedule
Define some basic resolution strategies in BW that BE can kick off when a exception condition is detected.
Use BE to manage and monitor Alert Conditions, and provide escalation logic to ensure that Alert Conditions are eventually cleared and dealt with.

Application Monitoring  
Owner  ITEC/ARC Emmanuel Marchiset  
Publication Date  December 2008  
Keywords  monitoring , bsm , application monitoring , tmon , gps

TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW AND CONTEXT
Monitoring solutions provide features to monitor the health and availability of an IT system in a real time or deferred fashion. This mainly includes capabilities to collect, process and historize indicators (kpi's) and to provide end users with dasboards, alerts and reports.

There are different types of Monitoring mainly depending on the end users target : Infrastructure Monitoring, Application Monitoring and Business Activity Monitoring.

Infrastructure Monitoring refers to the monitoring of technical resources availability and performance (network equipments, servers, databases,...). Infrastructure Monitoring tools are targeted to command center teams ('pilotage'). Infrastructure monitoring of ITEC resources is based on the Spice solution that is based on the CA NSM product (please refer to the Infrastructure Monitoring  card for more details).

Application Monitoring refers to the monitoring of applications availability, performance and quality. Application Monitoring tools are targeted to application support teams. Application Monitoring is also known in the IT industry as Business Service Monitoring ('BSM'), while it is possible in some scenarios to monitor services spread accross multiple applications.

Business Activity Monitoring (know as BAM) refers to the monitoring of business indicators and events (like the number of deals in error or the total amount of the suspended deals). BAM tools are targeted to Business people. At this time there is no BAM card in the IT RedBook.

Application Monitoring focuses on kpi's and events that covers elements related to the application activity (volume processed, ...), to the application behavior (start/end of batch, send / receive files, notification of errors... ), to the application resource usage (cpu, memory, connection, threads, ...) and generally also includes elements on infrastructure components that are critical for the application (such as servers or databases availability).

The main functionalities of Application Monitoring solutions are the following :

•Collection : these are the means to collect kpi's and events. Collection can be done in a non-intrusive approach by accessing application components like OS processes, log files, data files or databases, it can also be done in an intrusive approach where the application is instrumented with protocols like JMX or TIBCO Hawk or a custom protocol
•Historization and processing : these are the means to historize the KPI's and to apply rules on the KPI's to identify abnormal solutions and trigger alerts or automated actions. Rules can generally cover simple logical conditions (to manage thresholds) and more complex scenarios where multiple kpi's would be correlated with a complex logic.
•Presentation : this include user oriented features to manage alerts, build and display real time dashboard and generate reports
There is a number of Application Monitoring solutions on the market coming from large companies with Infrastructure Monitoring background (like HP, IBM or BMC) or from small companies specialized in this area (SYSTAR, ...).

ITEC STANDARDS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A cross-business line study has been done in 2008 and has shown that some ITEC BL's had made significant investments in homegrown Application Monitoring tools. These tools have been compared to market offerings and it has been decided to select the two main internal solutions has ITEC standard.

TMON, developed by ITEC GED, is oriented toward the non-intrusive monitoring of legacy applications. The main TMON features are the following :

•Non-intrusive collection : The TMON server is able to collect data from the following sources : local and remote scripts execution, databases, WEB pages, JMX, TIBCO Rendezvous, TIBCO Hawk. These capabilities can be extended with custom Java development.
•KPI's storage and processing : The TMON server is able to store the collected KPI's in a database and manage simple logic rules to trigger alerts and automated actions on threshold overflow basis.
•Dashboard and alert management : The TMON console includes alert management capabilities (highlight alert, acknowledge alert,...) and dashboard definition and display capabilities. Dashboard configurations are based on XML files and made of graphical widgets able to display real-time and historical data (simple displays, tabular displays, gauges, graphs,...).
GPS, developed by ITEC FIC, was initially oriented toward the monitoring of real-time trading systems and applications and has been extended to include application monitoring capabilities in both intrusive and non-intrusive approaches. The main GPS features are the following :

•Non-intrusive collection : The GPS server is able to collect data from the following sources : log files, JMX, WMI, TIBCO Rendezvous, REUTERS RMDS, TCP and UDP, local and remote scripts execution, databases, RTMA (a real time protocol from GED). These capabilities can be extended with custom C# development.
•Intrusive collection : The GPS API allows developers to instrument applications with capabilities to expose application kpi's to the GPS server and to notify the GPS server of application events
•KPI's storage and processing : The GPS server is able to store the collected KPI's in a database and manage rules to trigger alerts and automated actions. The GPS server includes a rules engine that is able to manage complex logical conditions and complex event correlations.
•Dashboard and alert management : The GPS console includes alert management capabilities and dashboard definition and display capabilities. Dashboard configurations are  built by assembly of .NET objects and made of graphical widgets able to display real-time and historical data (simple displays, tabular displays, gauges, graphs,...).
GPS has been recently extended with more Business oriented capabilities (Business Activity Monitoring). 

A detailled comparison of TMON and GPS features is available from ITEC ARC.

PRODUCTION OVERVIEW SUMMARY
Production support is directly made by ITEC BL's application support teams using TMON or GPS.

Monitoring Java and Non-Java applications
Now a days applications generate huge amount of log files by the application running on the server. Log4j is used to generate log files in a specific format and it is widely used in Java apps.
Reports are generated from these logs to view the status of the application or a process(Batch, FTP, ...).
Splunk is a good tool for Log management and also application monitoring.
There are many open-source tools used for monitoring the applications remotely.
